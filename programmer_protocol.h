// chunk size of 1024 bytes, though). The programmer will reply with OK or

// followed by either BootloaderEraseOK or BootloaderEraseError. At this point
// the program can ask to write more data or finish or cancel, and then the appropriate
// reply will be sent back to it. Works very similar to the write protocol.

// If the command is ErasePortion, the programmer will reply CommandReplyOK.
// Next, the program will send the beginning position to erase as a 4-byte little
// endian integer, followed by the length to erase as a 4-byte little endian
// integer. The programmer will reply with ProgrammerErasePortionOK to signify
// that the erase is beginning, followed by ProgrammerErasePortionFinished when
// everything is done.
// The length and position to erase must be on 256 KB boundaries and shouldn't
// go past the end of the selected type of chip. If any error occurs, it will
// reply with ProgrammerErasePortionError instead.
